Seth Godin - Life, the Internet, and Everything

.. epigraph::

   It is easy to keep track of what art is by what it is not. It's not
   following a manual, reading a dummies book, looking for a map. It tends
   to be people who work with a compass instead, who have an understanding
   of true north and are willing to solve a problem in an interesting way.
