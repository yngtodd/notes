Living With Questions: Can Conversation Make any difference at a Moment Like This?
----------------------------

.. epigraph::

   The meaning of conversation is not about words passing between mouths and ears,
   it is about shared life. Listening is about bringing our lives into conversation.

Unstructured Thoughts
---------------------

(Unstructured in the sense of these notes, not in the sense of Krista's framing. Each
of these points were brought up by Krista.)

* Conversation requires a certain level of trust, which often must be earned before
  the conversation can begin.

* What is possible in conversation is often framed before the conversation begins.

* Conversation, done well, strengthens relationship.

* Good conversation has good questions in it. It has really searching questions in it.
  It has genuine curiosity. 

My Thoughts (truly unstructured)
--------------------------------

* Does conversation require at least two people, or is it possible to enter into
  conversation with other parts of the world: a book, some music, nature? What would 
  it mean to be in conversation with a book, would that be the same as a conversation
  with the author?

* Conversation feels embodying. There is an animating force to it.

* Conversation absolutely requires engagement. 

* When I think of the great conversations I have had, they often felt like they were 
  not owned by me, or by the other person in the conversation for that matter. And it 
  feels like it is something you are *in*. It feels like a space that supports itself
  and supports the people within it. 

* Some of my favorite conversations have brought about ideas that I don't think I would
  be capable of myself. I find myself saying things that I did not think that I knew.
