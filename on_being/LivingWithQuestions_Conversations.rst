Living With Questions: Can Conversation Make any difference at a Moment Like This?
----------------------------

.. epigraph::

   The meaning of conversation is not about words passing between mouths and ears,
   it is about shared life. Listening is about bringing our lives into conversation.

   -- Krista Tippett

Unstructured Thoughts:

* Conversation requires a certain level of trust, which often must be earned before
  the conversation can begin.

* What is possible in conversation is often framed before the conversation begins.

* Conversation, done well, strengthens relationship.

* Good conversation has good questions in it. It has really searching questions in it.
  It has genuine curiosity.
