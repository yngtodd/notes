============================
Learning, in the Broad Sense
============================

My preferences for learning:

1. Externalization: Put what you are doing out there. Make something.
2. Interaction: Refining by working with externalized bits, and by talking 
   with others about the work.
3. Communication: This goes hand-in-hand with Externalization and Interaction. 
   Communication should be between people and the objects you are working with.
4. Critique: Refines my thinking and processes. This is a particular, sacred 
   version of communication.

This is why studio art is so great.
