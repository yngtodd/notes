Human-Computer Interaction and Reinforcement Learning
=====================================================

What happens when people don't know how to specify the rewards 
for a reinforcement learning agent, and the agent doesn't know
what the people want from it? Can we learn from one another,
building up the story as we go along? 

Christiano et al worked on a method to bring people in the loop for
reinforcement learning algorithms `[1]`_.

Potential PhD avenue: designing collaborative learning systems
that are safe and sample efficient, and communicative.
