Abstract
--------

This manuscript surveys reinforcement learning from the perspective of optimization 
and control with a focus on continuous control applications. It surveys the general 
formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement 
learning and reviews competing solution paradigms.



4. Simplifying theme: The Linear Quadratic Regulator
----------------------------------------------------

"Iâ€™d argue that in controls, the simplest non-trivial class of instances of optimal 
control is those with convex quadratic rewards and linear dynamics. That is, the 
problem of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR):"

#ToDo: add maths.
